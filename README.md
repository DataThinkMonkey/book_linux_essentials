# book_linux_essentials
Text Book for Linux Essential Course.

This is a very rough 1st draft. There are several spelling and grammatical errors.
Much of it will need to re-written and more chapters added. This is just a starting off point. 

Currently offered in markdown, docx and pdf, but will also make an epub version and possibly others.

I would eventually like to add case studies, exercises, chapter reviews, etc.
